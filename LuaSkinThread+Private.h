/*

    Private Interface to LuaSkinThread sub-class of LuaSkin

    These methods are generally not to be used outside of `hs._asm.luathread` and LuaSkinThread
    itself, as they can royally screw things up if you're not careful.

    Unless you have a specific need, it is highly suggested that you do not include this header
    in your projects and limit yourself to the methods and macros defined in LuaSkinThread.h

    You have been warned!
